**What we talked about today:**

- General checkup for members
- discussing modal for the delete all button - we decided to use same modal as distraction modal.
- discussing replacing "#" at the top of the task list with "# of pomos" or with a tomato
- toggle idea for switching between current and completed task list, use fast switch icon, and article on fonts goolge
- hide all top icons during pomo session but keep the header with our logo and brand name up
- Take out highlighting effect for when highlighting tasks
- Add back in the highlighting effect for FAQ, STATS, START, etc button
- discussing color and dark mode branch
- currently color branch has problem with refresh
- We all like the new logo:)
- stats, get rid of average distractions per task
- mobile tasklist: expand the borders, make it wider
- move timer to middle of screen when in pomo, make current task bigger, and add in estimated time to be done

ADR
- distract will end session, cannot see task list ever during a pomo
- distract will not end session, can open task list if you want but that is a distraction

- decided to kill session on distraction, and to hide the task list during a session without allowing the user to open it up. User can still see the current task though

ADR
- squares around timer and squares for icons
- squares around timer and circles for icons
- no squares around timer and squares for icons
- no squares around timer
- Don't worry about it, we like it the way it is
- This is what we decided ^

**For next meeting:**
- Continue design
- Prioritize issues
