**What we talked about today:**

- General checkup for members
- discussing modal for the delete all button - we decided to use same modal as distraction modal.
- discussing replacing "#" at the top of the task list with "# of pomos" or with a tomato
- toggle idea for switching between current and completed task list, use fast switch icon, and article on fonts goolge
- hide all top icons during pomo session
- Take out highlighting effect for when highlighting tasks
- Add back in the highlighting effect for FQ, STATS, START, etc button


ADR
- distract will end session, cannot see task list ever during a pomo
- distract will not end session, can open task list if you want but that is a distraction

- decided to kill session on distraction, and to hide the task list during a session without allowing the user to open it up. User can still see the current task though

**For next meeting:**
- Continue design
- Prioritize issues
