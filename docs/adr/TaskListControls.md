# Controls for how to move tasks in the tasklist

- Status: In development
- Date: 05/23/2022

## Context and Problem Statement

Deciding how to allow users to move tasks in a task list, whether to keep it the same as it had been (with a dot dot dot, and once clicked
showed a trashcan and a star for deletion/prioritization) or to remodel it with 4 buttons, one for prioritization, one for move up one,
one for down one, and one for delete

## Decision Drivers

### For:
* Decreases UI Gold
* Allows users to customize their task list more

### Against:
* Providing more options may be distracting
* Crowds up UI, as the options won't be hidden

## Considered Options

* Leave as is
* Make the 4 new buttons be ^^, ^, v, X (where ^^ is two ^ stacked on top of each other) and replace the dot dot dot on each task

## Decision Outcome
Make the 4 new buttons and replace the old task list functionality
